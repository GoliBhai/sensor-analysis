Sensor Data Analysis

This project analyzes sensor data stored in a CSV file containing timestamp, node, temperature, and humidity readings. 
It computes key statistics including the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures. Additionally, the script identifies temperature spikes and triggers alerts if the temperature exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 23Â°C). 
This analysis helps in monitoring and detecting anomalies in environmental data from sensor networks.
